    <h2><center><p>Hockey is an Amazing Sport and it is Lots of Fun for Various Reasons.</p></center></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>It is a fast paced game where players fly down the ice at remarkable speeds.</li>
    <li>There is a lot of physical contact that includs checking and fighting. Yeah people can fight.</li>
    <li>It isn't like soccer where people get sent to the ER because they got patted on the back (that literaly happens) but hockey players actually get up and shake it off and just play the game, one time a players throat got cut open from a skate and he didn't just lie down he acually got up and left the rink to get taken care of. And after he recovered he got back on the ice!</li>
    <li>If you want to win a hockey game you have to have teamwork, you have to pass the puck to teammates because if you just try to score by yourself trust me, it won't happen.</li>

    <h2><center>Now Here's a Little About My Hockey Career</center></h2>
    <p>I have been playing hockey now for 8 years and I am still playing it today. I play for the Hyland Hills Jaguars and I have always played for them. For most of my career I have been playing left wing exept when I played center last year, I really hope I can do that again. I love hockey because I get to play with my friends but also because of the physical contact and the skill you need to master the sport. I mean, you have to learn walking again basically. So if you are looking for a sport to play, you should play hockey. It's awesome!</p>
